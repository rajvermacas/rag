Brainstorm.
I am trying to build a RAG pipeline.
Openrouter should be used.

A UI should be built using tailwind css, fastapi.
There should be a file upload button which should read files like pdf, docx, text.

And then there should be a chatbot which should help talk to the doc.
-----------------------------------

Right now the chatbot clearly mentions that "I dont know" if the user prompt is generic. 
I want the chatbot to intelligently say that This is what i found over the document as per the citation and here is what i know (coming from general training)
